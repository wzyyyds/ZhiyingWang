> I graduated in the summer of **2025**, and I will begin my PhD studies at **North Carolina State University (NCSU)** in **August 2025**.

My name is **Zhiying Wang**. I obtained my master's degree from the [University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), where I was supervised by Professor [Gang Sun](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=aUPwLyYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), and was a member of the [Intelligent Network and Applications Team](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/kxyj/kytd/wlgcx/zhwljyytd.htm#). Prior to that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Hebei University of Technology](https://eweb.hebut.edu.cn/).

My **research interests** include Mobile Edge Computing (MEC), Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), Internet of Things (IoT), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). I also maintain a strong curiosity about other cutting-edge research areas.

Outside of my academic life, I have a passion for **tennis** and enjoy relaxing and exercising in my spare time.
