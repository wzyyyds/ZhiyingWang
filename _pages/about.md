> I will graduate in the summer of 2025, and I am actively seeking a PhD position...

My name is Wang Zhiying (Zoe). I am currently a second-year master's student at [the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China](https://en.uestc.edu.cn/), under the supervision of Professor [Sun Gang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=aUPwLyYAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate), in the [Intelligent Network and Applications Team](https://www.sice.uestc.edu.cn/kxyj/kytd/wlgcx/zhwljyytd.htm#). Prior to this, I completed my undergraduate studies at [Hebei University of Technology](https://eweb.hebut.edu.cn/).

My current research interests include Mobile Edge Computing(MEC), Deep Reinforcement Learning(DRL), Internet of Things (IoT), and Unmanned Aerial Vehicle(UAV). However, I also have a significant interest in other cutting-edge areas.

Apart from my work, I have a great interest in tennis. I enjoy relaxing and exercising in my free time.
