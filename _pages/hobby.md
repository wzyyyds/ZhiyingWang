## 🎾 TENNIS!!!

I have been involved in tennis for about **three years**, and I think tennis is a great sport for **relieving stress**. The pressure flies away with the ball the moment you hit it. Additionally, playing tennis has helped me **stay fit** and I have made many **like-minded friends** through the sport.

## 🚴‍♀ CYCLING!!!

I think cycling is somewhat similar to the **20-minute park effect**; it helps me recover from the stress and fatigue of daily life. Riding through the city or village, listening to my favorite songs, and sorting out my thoughts, is like what is mentioned in the movie 'Roman Holiday': 

> You can either travel or read, but either your body or soul must be on the way.
